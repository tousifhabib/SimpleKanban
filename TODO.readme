nana bhai, your board already has the core loop nailed (columns/cards CRUD + drag for both + localStorage + nice FLIP). The next “good” features are the ones that add real usefulness **without** turning it into Jira.

### High-impact features (worth doing first)

**1) Card details (real “task” object)**

* Add fields: `description`, `dueDate`, `labels[]`, `priority`, `checklist[]`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
* UX: click card opens a modal (like your Add Column modal) instead of `prompt()`.
* Where it fits: extend `store.js` card shape + new `CardDetailsModal` component + update `Card.js` to open it.

**2) Search + quick filter**

* Search box in header filters visible cards by text.
* Filters: label, priority, due date (“overdue”, “today”, “this week”).
* Where: a small “ui state” (search query, active filters) in `KanbanBoard` (doesn’t need to persist), and render only matching cards.

**3) Undo / redo (and/or “toast undo”)**

* Users will mis-drag or delete columns/cards. Undo makes the app feel “safe”.
* Implementation: keep a history stack of previous `state` snapshots in `store.js` (cap at like 30).
* Bonus: after delete, show toast “Deleted card — Undo”.

**4) Column WIP limits**

* Per-column “max cards” number; when exceeded, show a subtle warning + optionally block dropping into that column.
* Where: `columnData.wipLimit`, enforce in `KanbanBoard.handleDrop()` when target column changes.

**5) Keyboard shortcuts**

* Examples:

  * `N` = new card (in focused column)
  * `/` = focus search
  * `Esc` = close modals
  * `Enter` to save edits in card modal
* Makes it feel pro with minimal code.

### Next tier (still very useful)

**6) Inline card add (faster flow)**

* You already show the add-card form; add “Enter submits, Shift+Enter newline”.
* Also add “Add card to top/bottom” preference per column.

**7) Drag improvements**

* Auto-scroll horizontally when dragging near left/right edges of `.kanban-container`.
* Add a visible placeholder “drop indicator” so it’s clearer where the card will land.
* (Optional) switch to Pointer Events + custom ghost later, but you can keep native drag for now.

**8) Export / import board**

* Export JSON to file; import JSON file to restore/share.
* Where: header buttons; use `URL.createObjectURL(new Blob(...))` for download.

**9) Multiple boards / workspaces**

* Right now you persist one `STORAGE_KEY`. Support many boards:

  * `STORAGE_KEY = flexibleKanbanState:<boardId>`
  * board selector in header
* This is a “big perceived upgrade” with small structural change.

**10) Analytics-lite**

* Count cards per column, “done this week”, average cycle time (if you add timestamps).
* Display small badges in column header.

### “Polish” features that make it feel finished

**11) Better editing than `contenteditable` for column title**

* `contenteditable` is fine, but you’ll eventually hit weirdness (paste formatting, newlines).
* Swap to “click to edit” -> input field -> save on blur/enter.

**12) Accessibility**

* Focus trapping inside modal, `aria` labels for action buttons, keyboard-accessible card actions.
* Add “reorder with keyboard” fallback (optional).

**13) Theme + settings**

* Light/dark toggle, compact mode, show/hide animations/debug overlays.
* Your CSS variables make this super easy.

### Engineering cleanups that unlock features

These aren’t user features, but they make the above painless:

* **Centralize ID generation**: you have `store.generateId()` and also `utils.generateId()`. Pick one.
* **Separate “UI state” vs “data state”**: data in `store`, UI in `KanbanBoard` (filters, open modals, selected card).
* **Debug overlays toggle**: right now `.cards` and `.column` have forced debug outlines in CSS. Wrap those in a `.debug` body class so you can turn it on/off.

### If you want the best “wow per hour”

If you only build **three** next, I’d do:

1. **Card details modal** (description, labels, due date)
2. **Search + filters**
3. **Undo**

Those three make it feel like a real product immediately.

If you tell me which direction you want (personal todo vs team-ish board), I’ll propose the best data model changes and the minimal set of new components/files to add.
